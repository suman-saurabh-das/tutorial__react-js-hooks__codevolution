/*
    We have created the iseEven function to check whether a number is odd or even and to induce slowness in this calculation, we have used while loop, (to mimic real world application slowness)
    Initially, we see that the on clicking increment1, there is a slowness but on clicking increment2 also there is a slowness, this is because every time the state updates, the component re-renders, and when the component re-renders, isEven is called again. Hence even though we update counter2, the UI update is slow.

    We need to tell react not to calculate certain values when unnecessary (long computation ones). 
    i.e. we can tell not to re-calculate isEven when pressing counter2, using useMemo hook.

    useMemo is a hook that will only re-compute the cached value, when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculation in every render.
    It accepts 2 parameters -
        callback function - function whose return value needs to be cached. It returns a value.
        dependency list - parameters which we need to check for.

    Now, after implementing useMemo hook, if we click on counter2, there is no delay as the cached value of isEven is being used during re-render as counter1 is not changing.

    Difference between useCallback and useMemo
    useCallback - caches the provided function instance itself.
    useMemo - invokes the provided function and caches its result.

    When you want to cache a function, useCallback.
    When you want to cache the result of a invoked function, useMemo.
